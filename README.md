# TireSizeCalculator
This assignment was created for my Android Development course that I attended during college. It was a project that I had been meaning to make for quite a while but due to time constraints during that semester I was not able to create a more visually appealing GUI.

This is a barebones android app that makes use of a DB(SQLite) and a basic android user interface. It allows the user to save cars/vehicles to their own database or 'garage'. Basic values about the vehicle (year, make, model and OEM tire size[tread width, aspect ratio and rim diameter]) are saved to the garage.

The user can then select a car from the garage to draw comparisons from by selecting a new tire size. After inputting the data and choosing to calculate the variance, the program will provide the user with the data regarding the difference between the two sizes of tire.
